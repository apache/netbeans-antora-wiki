== How is MimeLookup composed?

In order to get xref:DevFaqEditorWhatIsMimeLookup.adoc[MimeLookup] you have to supply
xref:DevFaqEditorWhatIsMimePath.adoc[MimePath]. With the default `MimeLookup`
implementation provided by Netbeans the contents of `MimeLookup` is defined by
a hierarchical structure of folders on the system FileSystem. The structure
starts in the `Editors` folder and then follows all the components of the `MimePath` you
have supplied.

For example if you ask for `MimeLookup` for the following `MimePath` of
`text/x-java` you will get `Lookup` with contents from the following
folders:

[source,java]
----

    Editors/text/x-java
    Editors
----

As you can see `MimeLookup` for `text/x-java` contains not only editor
features registered for the `text/x-java` mime type itself, but it also
inherits general features registered for an empty `MimePath` (i.e. in the
root of the hierarchy).

The inheritence algorithm used for composing `MimeLookup` for a given
`MimePath` supports more than just simple inheritance from the root. It also
supports compound mime types such as `text/x-ant+xml` and embedded mime types
such as `text/x-jsp/text/x-java`.

=== Compound mime types

Let's have a look at the `MimeLookup` composition for a compound mime type
`text/x-ant+xml`. The resulting `Lookup` will contain things registered in
the following folders:

[source,java]
----

    Editors/text/x-ant+xml
    Editors/text/xml
    Editors
----

That's the reason why editor features provided by XML modules for general
XML files work also for specialized, but XML-based, files.

=== Embedded mime types

The inheritance hierarchy becomes even more complicated when dealing with embedded mime
types. Let's use a java scriplet inside a JSP page as an example of language embedding.
The `MimePath` for the scriplet is `text/x-jsp/text/x-java` and its `MimeLookup` will
contain features registered in the following folders:

[source,java]
----

    Editors/text/x-jsp/text/x-java
    Editors/text/x-java
    Editors
----

The algorithm for computing the inheritance tree for a particular `MimePath`
combines all the above cases together and works always the same way no matter what
feature you are going to look for in the resulting `MimeLookup`.
