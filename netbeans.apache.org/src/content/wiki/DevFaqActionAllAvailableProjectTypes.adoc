== How determine all available project types?

* create a new nbm-module using the "_New Project..._"-wizard and choose your target platform
* create a layer.xml using the "_New File..._"-wizard
* expand the nodes "_Important Files/XML Layer/<this layer in context>/Projects_" within the project view
* the direct childnodes of "Projects" are the supported project types of the target platform (see the screenshot below)

The project type can be used for extending the project properties - See xref:DevFaqActionAddProjectCustomizer.adoc[DevFaqActionAddProjectCustomizer].

=== Example of some available types in NetBeans 7.2
