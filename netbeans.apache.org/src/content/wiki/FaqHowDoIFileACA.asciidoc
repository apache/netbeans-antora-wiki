== How do I file a completed CA?

Oracle must have a fax or hard copy of the CA on file before Oracle can accept contributions and update the list of contributors with an accepted CA. You will find a blank form of the CA at: link:http://oss.oracle.com/oca.pdf[http://oss.oracle.com/oca.pdf]. The CA is in .pdf format (on purpose - we need a format not intended for modification).



1. Print it, mourn the loss of a tree, fill it out and sign it. Please take care to print your details very clearly, including your *postal and email* address. Also don't forget to *check one statement* in the 7th paragraph regarding scope of your CA.




[start=2]
. Scan it and email it to link:mailto:oracle-ca_us@oracle.com[oracle-ca_us@oracle.com]




[start=3]
. Please check link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/goto/oca[list of approved CA signatories] for your name in the days following your submission. If your name does not show up, or shows up incorrectly, please contact link:mailto:jiri.kovalsky@oracle.com[Jiri Kovalsky] - NetBeans Community Manager.
