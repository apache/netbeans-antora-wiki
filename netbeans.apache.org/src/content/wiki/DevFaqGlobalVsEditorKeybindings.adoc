== What are editor-specific keybindings and how are they different from global ones?

The editor has its own mechanism for registering keybindings, which is separate from global keybindings (in essence, they belong to the Swing EditorKit for the editor, but there are some registration mechanisms in the editor for this).  So if you want to register a keyboard shortcut only against the editor when editing a certain type of file (as opposed to a keyboard shortcut that is a shortcut for an action on the main menu), you'll be using editor-based keybindings.

If there is a global shortcut bound to a key combination, and also an editor-specific one defined for the type of file being edited, the editor wins if the editor has focus.
