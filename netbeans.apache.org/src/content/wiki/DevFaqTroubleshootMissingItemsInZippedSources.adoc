== I find files missing from the source ZIP file

If you've downloaded and unpacked the ZIP file containing NetBeans sources but find that it seems incomplete, try using another application to unpack the ZIP file.  It seems that the popular WinZip application cannot properly handle this file.

The link:http://www.7-zip.org/[7-Zip application] is free, open source and is known to correctly handle the NetBeans ZIP sources.  

link:http://www.info-zip.org/[Info-ZIP] is a free command-line unzip utility for Windows and OS/2 which has been around for more than a decade.

Alternatively, you could write a simple Ant script to use the `unzip` task for decompressing the archive, or use a ported version of a Unix unzip utility for Windows.
