== Good Tools Make Everything Simpler

The NetBeans IDE 6.7 is here to embrace its users. 

The best way to do it is to establish a synergy between the NetBeans developers
and their users/partners using the IDE. The NetBeans community has always been
wonderful, provided a lot of valuable feedback. Moreover our community is of
developers. We can asked them to debug, profile, and even fix, if we give them
the right tools.

We are proud to announce that the NetBeans IDE 6.7 has been enhanced with
several self diagnostic tools to help with "in field" identification of what is
wrong and to simplify submission for such reports to appropriate developers. 


[[Profile_The_IDE]]
== Profile The IDE!

There is a dedicated "Profile The IDE!" button in the toolbar to start, stop
self profiling in _any distribution that includes NetBeans Profiler_. 

* Make sure the Performance toolbar is displayed (step 0). 
* Then click on the button to let the system start capturing thread dumps from
the running IDE (step 1). In case the button is not visible go to Tools/Plugins
and enable _Java Profiler_. 
* Then work in the IDE, emulate an action which seems to be slow. 
* Press the button again to turn the self profiling off (step 2). 
* The system then generates standard NetBeans Profiler IDE snapshot and shows it.

Now the time has come to analyse the dump or use the "Attach IDE Snapshot to
bug..." button to attach it
to already existing issue.

The work was meant as a joint venture of the profiler and performance teams.
However most of the glory belongs to profiler team. It donated the sampler,
redesigned way to convert its results into its snapshot format and also
provided basic UI integration. The performance team encouraged that, helped
with planning and provided emotional support.

The work is useful of its own, but there is much more to be done.
link:http://visualvm.dev.java.net[VisualVM] can benefit from the sampler as
well. The automatic analysis of slowness can be also very helpful during
testing and help NetBeans faster understand own performance
problems.

[[Am_I_Leaking]]
== Am I Leaking!?

More of xref:FitnessViaTimersCounter.adoc[FitnessViaTimersCounters] and xref:FitnessMemoryLeaks.adoc[FitnessMemoryLeaks].


[[Snapshot_me]]
== Snapshot me!

In case the system throws OutOfMemory exception a file is generated to
$userdir/var/log or similar directory and the user is asked (maybe on next
start) to send this file to NetBeans.

Requires changes to launcher to pass in additional parameter and a way to
transfer 400MB file to issuezilla.
