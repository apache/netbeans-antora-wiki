== Q: How do I show that a user has filled an invalid input into my wizard?

A: Set the `WizardPanel_errorMessage` property in the WizardPanel instance that is related to the displayed panel. 

Example:

`wizardDescriptor.putProperty("WizardPanel_errorMessage", NbBundle.getMessage(MyPanel1.class, "key"));`

*_Note_*: Since WizardDescritor, spec.version 7.8 (i.e.since link:http://www.netbeans.org/downloads/index.html[NetBeans 6.5 Platform])

* you can use `WizardDescriptor.PROP_ERROR_MESSAGE` instead of "WizardPanel_errorMessage".
* beside `WizardDescriptor.PROP_ERROR_MESSAGE` you can also use `WizardDescriptor.PROP_WARNING_MESSAGE` for warning messages or `WizardDescriptor.PROP_INFO_MESSAGE` for information messages.
* All kind of messages will be badged with appropriate icons: error image:Error.gif[], warning image:Warning.gif[], info image:info.png[]
* To clean the message just call `wizardDescriptor.putProperty(WizardDescriptor.PROP_ERROR_MESSAGE, null);`

You can obtain the instance of `WizardDescriptor` in the `WizardDescriptor.Panel.readSettings` as `settings` parameter method.

== Update in NetBeans 6.8

Two new methods in `NotifyDescriptor` were added to allow API client to create link:http://bits.nbextras.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-dialogs/org/openide/NotificationLineSupport.html[NotificationLineSupport] which allow handling error/warning/info messages in dialogs. If a dialog descriptor creates this support, `DialogDisplayer`  allocates necessary space at the bottom of dialog where API clients can set info/warning/error messages with appropriate icons.
