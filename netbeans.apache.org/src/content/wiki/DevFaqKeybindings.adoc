== How do keybindings work?

Keybindings are specified in yet another folder in the xref:DevFaqSystemFilesystem.adoc[system filesystem ].  The folder Shortcuts/ contains xref:DevFaqInstanceDataObject.adoc[.instance files] or xref:DevFaqDotShadowFiles.adoc[.shadow files] (shadow files are like symlinks to another file in the system fs) - these map to Actions.

The file name for the action (`.instance` or `.shadow`) file in `Shortcuts/` is used to specify what keys are bound.  This is done using an link:https://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-util/org/openide/util/Utilities.html#stringToKey(java.lang.String)[emacs-like syntax for specifying keybindings] - e.g., `CA-P` equals Ctrl-Alt-P.

For a full listing of the hard-coded and cross-platform prefixes for key definitions, see link:https://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-util/org/openide/util/Utilities.html#stringToKey(java.lang.String)[the javadoc for Utilities.stringToKey()] - that and its analogue, `Utilities.keyToString()` are used to encode and decode these.

There are special modifier characters which xref:DevFaqLogicalKeybindings.adoc[map to Command on Mac and Ctrl on PC, Ctrl on Mac and Alt on PC].  You should use those unless you're _really sure_ your app will never be used on macintosh or never be used by someone with a non-English macintosh.

Here is an example of what a layer file might look like if you bound the Ctrl+Shift+Equals sequence to the `com.tomwheeler.example.fooviewer.FooAction` action:
