== Can I add a menu item to the context menu of the Java source editor?

Yes. In NetBeans 5.0 and later there is a wizard available for NetBeans modules which does this for you. Just run *New File | NetBeans Module Development | Action*, as an action type choose *Conditionally Enabled*. On the next step choose `text/x-java` in the *Editor Context Menu Item* combobox, finish the wizard and you are done. For more information you may press the *Help* button available at the bottom of each step of the wizard.

In NetBeans 4.1 you just need to insert an action (e.g. `*.instance` ) into the folder `Editors/text/x-java/Popup/` in your module's XML layer.

Applies to: all versions of NetBeans
