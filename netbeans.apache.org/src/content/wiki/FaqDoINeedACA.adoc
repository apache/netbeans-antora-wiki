== Do I have to fill out a Contributor Agreement?

Yes, you _must_ fill out a Contributor Agreement, if

* you intend to contribute *source code or other materials including IDE localizations,* regardless of the size of the contribution, which are intended to be _compiled or otherwise integrated with the NetBeans product_. 

All contributors to the *NetBeans.org website* _should_ fill out the CA, as it makes it easier to keep track of contributions. 

* If you contribute web content to netbeans.org such as *web page translations, tech tips, etc,* which will _not be included in the product itself_, then the NetBeans Terms of use govern and no Contributor Agreement is needed. 
* If you contribute web content to netbeans.org such as *complete articles, presentations, flash demos, etc*, which will _not be included in the product itself_, then we would prefer you to sign the CA agreement. If you don't, the Terms of Use automatically apply.
