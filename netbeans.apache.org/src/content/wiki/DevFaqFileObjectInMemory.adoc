== How can I create a FileObject in memory?

Sometimes it's desirable to work with a file (or call code that expects to operate on files), but you don't want to commit it permanently to disk.  It's easy to do this in NetBeans by using the in-memory filesystem.  The first two lines in the following code will create a new text file and the next three will open it in an editor.  You can easily change this to handle other types of files provided that their DataObject's also have an OpenCookie.

[source,java]
----

    FileSystem fs = FileUtil.createMemoryFileSystem();
    FileObject fob = fs.getRoot().createData(name, "txt");

    DataObject data = DataObject.find(fob);
    OpenCookie cookie = (OpenCookie)data.getCookie(OpenCookie.class);
    cookie.open();
