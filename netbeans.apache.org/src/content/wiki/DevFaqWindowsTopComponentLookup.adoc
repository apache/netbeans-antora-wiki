== Why does `TopComponent` have a `getLookup()` method? What is it for?

The windowing system is what manages xref:DevFaqTrackGlobalSelection.adoc[global selection].  In olden times, selection meant the activated xref:DevFaqWhatIsANode.adoc[Node].

In modern NetBeans, the global selection is really whatever objects are in the focused  `xref:DevFaqWindowsTopComponent.adoc[TopComponent]`'s xref:DevFaqLookup.adoc[Lookup].  It so happens that most standard TopComponents display `xref:DevFaqWhatIsANode.adoc[Node]`s - so for most `TopComponent`s, the component's `Lookup` is just proxying the `Lookup` of the selected Node.

Rather than thinking of the selection as some specific object or Node, it is more useful to think of it as a grab bag of stuff provided by whatever component happens to have focus.  If you use `xref:DevFaqTrackGlobalSelection.adoc[Utilities.actionsGlobalContext()]`, you do not have to track all the different grab-bags of stuff provided by different components - you can get one grab bag of stuff which whose content will simply change (notifying you in the process) when focus moves to a different component.

So the `TopComponent`'s `Lookup` is a way to provide your particular grab bag of stuff - it can be the lookup of a `Node` if you want, or it can be/contain whatever else or in addition you'd like to put there.
