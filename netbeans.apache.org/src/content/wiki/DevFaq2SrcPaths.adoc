== How do I have two source directories within one module?

Adding an extra source directories is possible in case you need to create a separate output JARs (besides the module itself), generally with its own special classpath.

In your module's `project.xml`, add a declaration of the source root just before `</data>`:

[source,xml]
----

<extra-compilation-unit>
    <package-root>othersrc</package-root>
    <classpath>...anything it might need to compile against...</classpath>
    <built-to>build/otherclasses</built-to>
    <built-to>${cluster}/modules/ext/other.jar</built-to>
</extra-compilation-unit>
----

This declaration has no effect on the build, but lets you work with the sources in the IDE's code editor.

You will separately need to add a target to your `build.xml` to compile and package these sources however you like.
(You can name your target `netbeans-extra` and it will get run automatically toward the end of the module's build cycle.)
If you define properties like a special classpath in `project.properties`,
you can use the values in both `build.xml` and `project.xml` to minimize duplication.

You can also create a plain Java SE project in a subdirectory of your module
and bundle its JAR. xref:DevFaqWrapperModules.adoc[DevFaqWrapperModules] describes a related technique.

Read the `harness/README` file under your Netbeans installation directory
for information about issues like this one.
The build harness has many capabilities not exposed through the GUI.
