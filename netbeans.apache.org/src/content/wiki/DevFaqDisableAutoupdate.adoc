== Can I disable Auto Update (for example, while running tests)?

The IDE often checks for updates on startup.
This behavior may not be desired in some cases;
for example, when running tests on the GUI,
because they can slow the application down or potentially change its behavior
from what you expected.
In order to prevent the Auto Update check,
run the application with the `netbeans.full.hack` system property set to `true`.
For example, use `-J-Dnetbeans.full.hack=true` on the command line.

Setting this property has some other side-effects; see: xref:DevFaqNetBeansFullHack.adoc[DevFaqNetBeansFullHack]

Functional tests using `NbModuleSuite` get this property set automatically.
So do unit tests using `NbTestCase` (though they would rarely need it anyway).


Applies to: NetBeans 6.5 and later
