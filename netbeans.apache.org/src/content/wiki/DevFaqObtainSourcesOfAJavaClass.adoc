== How do I obtain a source file for a Java class and open it in the editor?

Sometimes it is necessary to open source code for a Java file from your NetBeans plug-in.
The source code may be located in the currently open projects, in a library or in the platform JRE.
It is assumed that libraries and platform JRE have associated sources in your environment.
The associations are configured from the *Tools > Libraries* and 
*Tools > Java Platform* menu items.

Here is an example of how to find a `FileObject` corresponding to the class `javax.swing.JComponent`:

[source,java]
----

String classResource = "javax/swing/JComponent.java";
for (FileObject curRoot : GlobalPathRegistry.getDefault().getSourceRoots()) {
    FileObject fileObject = curRoot.getFileObject(classResource);
    if (fileObject != null) {
        // source file object found
        // do something, e.g. openEditor(fileObject, lineNumber);
        return;
    }
}
----

In the `if` block you can do something with the source file you found.
For example, you can open it in the Java editor.
xref:DevFaqOpenFileAtLine.adoc[DevFaqOpenFileAtLine] describes how.
