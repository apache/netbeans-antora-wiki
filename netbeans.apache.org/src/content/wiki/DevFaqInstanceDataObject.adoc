== What are `*.instance` files?

`*.instance` files represent an "instance", i.e. arbitrary Java object.

An instance file typically says what class it is an instance of via its class name - for example,
`com-foo-mymodule-MyObject.instance`.
A `*.instance` file may create its instance from any Java class
with a default constructor, or by calling a static method on a class.

In NetBeans infrastructure, `*.instance` files result in `InstanceDataObject`s.
`InstanceDataObject`s can supply `InstanceCookie`s,
which in turn instantiate the object.
So, code to actually get an instance of an object declared in the system filesystem  (xref:DevFaqSystemFilesystem.adoc[DevFaqSystemFilesystem]) would look like this (plus error checking):

[source,java]
----

public static Object getTheObject(String pathInSystemFilesystem) throws Exception {
    return DataObject.find(FileUtil.getConfigFile(pathInSystemFilesystem)).
        getLookup().lookup(InstanceCookie.class).instanceCreate();
}
----

(FileUtil.getConfigObject is available for this purpose in NB 7.1+.)

A much easier way to get all instances of objects in a folder exists:

[source,java]
----

for (WhatISaidToPutHere instance :
        Lookups.forPath("MyFolder").lookupAll(WhatISaidToPutHere.class)) {
    // ...
}
----

Note that a default constructor is not required in an XML layer;  you can also use a static method, using the following syntax:

[source,xml]
----

<file name="ObjectTypes.instance">
  <attr name="instanceCreate" methodvalue="org.netbeans.core.ui.UINodes.createObjectTypes"/>
  <attr name="instanceOf" stringvalue="org.openide.nodes.Node"/>
</file>
----

(The `instanceOf` attribute is optional;
it lets the system avoid instantiating your object just to see if it is assignable to `Node`.
This is only useful in folders that contain objects of many different types mixed together,
which is normally true only in the semi-deprecated `Services` folder:
code looking for instances of one type only would rather not load everything.)
