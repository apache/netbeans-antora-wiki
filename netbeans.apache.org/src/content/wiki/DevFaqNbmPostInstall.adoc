== How to specify post-install code in xref:NBM.adoc[NBM]

xref:NBM.adoc[NBM] allows to declare its own custom code in xref:NBM.adoc[NBM] archive. This code is called-back by `Autoupdate/Updater` at the end of installation of xref:NBM.adoc[NBM] into IDE.

[source,java]
----


your_module.nbm
     |   
     +- Info
     |   |
     |   +--- info.xml
     |
    +- netbeans
        |
        +--- modules...
    |
    +-main
        |
        +--- main.properties
        +--- <custom code>

----

If Autoupdate/Updater detects `main` directory in the NBM archive then `main.properties` descriptor contains information about the own code. `Updater` runs specified Java code according to these properties.

The properties expected in _main.properties_ are:

|===
|Property |Value 

|mainClass |name of the main class, run after module installation from the NBM 

|relativeClassPath |classpath elements, may contain more elements 

|jvm.parameters |properties for JVM, arguments inserted before the main class name 

|mainClass.arguments |more arguments for the main class, added after the main class name 
|===

The run command is built on top of properties above.

xref:DevFaqNbmPostInstall.adoc#1[#1] *Problem*: There was a bug: variable `%IDE_USER%` contained as same value as `%IDE_HOME%` i.e. both links to the platform cluster directory and %IDE_HOME% *didn't* contain user directory as should be. It was fixed in NetBeans 6.5 platform.

The properties can contain several special variables which `Autoupdate` replaces by real values:

|===
|Variable |Value 

|%IDE_HOME% |platform directory 

|%IDE_USER% |user directory [[1]] 

|%FS% |file separator char 

|%PS% |path separator char 

|%JAVA_HOME% |the current Java home 
|===

=== Example

* Download and unzip a project xref:Media:samplepostinstall_DevFaqNbmPostInstall.zip.adoc[samplepostinstall_DevFaqNbmPostInstall.zip]
* Go into `samplepostinstall/main` directory
* In `main` directory is main class `Hello` which should use most of possibilities of _post-install_ hooks
* Using properties `mainClass`, `relativeClassPath`, `jvm.parameters` etc.
* Reads all special variables like `%IDE_HOME%`, `%JAVA_HOME%` etc.
* Opens some GUI
* Runs a JDK demo

To see that `samplepostinstall` project in action

1. download xref:Media:org-netbeans-samplepostinstall_DevFaqNbmPostInstall.nbm.adoc[NBM]
2. run NetBeans IDE (6.0 or newer)
3. invoke _Tools|Plugins_ and switch to _Download_ tab
4. add the downloaded NBM
5. install it and then watch post-install hook what will be executed while installing that plugin
