== Files vs. file objects

What exactly is the difference between a filename on disk and a
`FileObject`? How do I convert them?

Raw files on disk are generally represented in Java using `java.io.File`. These correspond directly to what the operating system thinks of as a file.

Under the Filesystems API, raw files are not usually manipulated
directly. Rather, you should usually be using `FileObject`.
Besides the fact that most other APIs that
work with files expect `FileObject`, these have a
number of advantages:

* The filesystem they come from need not correspond to physical files on disk, but could be JAR file entries, or potentially database entries, FTP downloads, etc.

* The rest of the IDE can interact with them in an object-oriented fashion, including locking and change notification.

However a `FileObject` must always really exist on disk (or whatever backing storage is used), unlike `File`.

In case translation from one to the other is necessary:

* To look for a `FileObject` representing a `File`, use `FileUtil.toFileObject(File)`.
* To look for a `File` from a `FileObject`, you may use `FileUtil.toFile(FileObject)`.
