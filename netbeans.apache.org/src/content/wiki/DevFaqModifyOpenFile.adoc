== Is it safe to programmatically modify a file which is open in the editor?

It is not safe to modify a `FileObject` (via `getOutputStream`) which is open and _modified_ in the editor. In fact, it is not possible: calling `FileObject.lock()` will fail. If you modify the `java.io.File` (bypassing the Filesystems API) you may cause a conflict.

If the file is not modified in the editor (easily checkable via `DataObject.isModified()`) then after your output stream is closed the file will be reloaded with the new contents.

If the file _is_ modified you can make changes to the open editor buffer: use `EditorCookie` to acquire the Swing `Document` and make changes through that. It may be considered impolite to then save the file if it was modified before.

Applies to: NetBeans 4.0 and newer
