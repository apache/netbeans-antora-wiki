== I have a .instance file. How do I get an actual object instance?

Using `InstanceCookie` (note that if you have an entire folder of `.instance` files, there's a xref:DevFaqFolderOfInstances.adoc[more efficient way ] to get all of them):

[source,java]
----

DataObject dob = DataObject.find (theDotInstanceFileObject);
InstanceCookie ck = dob.getLookup().lookup(InstanceCookie.class);
MyObject obj = (MyObject) ck.instanceCreate();

----

(you can and should call `ck.instanceClass()` to ensure the type cast is correct ahead of time)

=== Alternative:

[source,java]
----

T obj=FileUtil.getConfigObject("Actions/Window/org-foo-B.instance", T.class) 

//for example:
Action action=FileUtil.getConfigObject("Actions/Window/org-netbeans-core-windows-actions-ResetWindowsAction.instance", Action.class) 

----
