== How can I launch an Ant Task on all modules of my suite?

I needed to launch the fix-dependencies target on all the modules of my suite, but doing manually is very boring. So I added this target into my suite build.xml that runs the target in each module

[source,xml]
----

<target name="fix-dependencies" depends="-init">
  <subant target="fix-dependencies" buildpath="${modules.sorted}" inheritrefs="false" inheritall="false"/>
</target>
----

You can change the code so it works with any target.

Applies to: NetBeans IDE 6.5 and newer
Platforms: All
