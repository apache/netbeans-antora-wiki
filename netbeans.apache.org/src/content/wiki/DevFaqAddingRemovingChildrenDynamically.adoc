== Can I add or remove children of a node on the fly?

Yes.  Have your node subclass link:https://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-nodes/org/openide/nodes/AbstractNode.html[AbstractNode]
or whatever else you like.

*NB 6 > m9 Specific*:
Implement `ChildFactory`.  To create the `Children` object for your Node, pass it to `Children.create()`.  When the child list needs updating, call `refresh()` on your `ChildFactory`.  Its `createKeys` method will be called again and you can update the set of key objects as needed;  Nodes for objects that remain in the list of keys will simply continue to exist;  additions and removals will be handled.

*NB 5 And Earlier*:
Have your `Children` object subclass link:https://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-nodes/org/openide/nodes/Children.Keys.html[Children.Keys].
As needed, call `setKeys()` on the `Children.Keys` object.
Just by passing a larger or smaller (or reordered) list of keys, you will be adding or removing (or reordering) children.

Do not _ever_ try to add/remove children from a node you
did not create (unless it has an API that explicitly gives you permission to do that); occasionally
people try to add child nodes to nodes for things like Java files.  If it works at all it's by accident.
