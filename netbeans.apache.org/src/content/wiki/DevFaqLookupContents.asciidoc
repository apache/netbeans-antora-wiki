== How can I find out what is in a Lookup?

The simplest way is to call `Lookup.toString()`.  If you want the output in a more readable form, do the following and print/format the resulting collection as you wish:

[source,java]
----

Collection<?> c = theLookup.lookupAll(Object.class);
for (Object o : c) {
  //do what you want
}

----

*<u>Do not</u> do either of these things in production code!*
