== How to mix lightweight (Swing) and heavyweight (AWT) components?

Since JDK 6 update 12 and JDK 7, support for mixing of AWT (heavyweight, native widgets) and Swing (lightweight, pure Java widgets) is available and usually works quite well. However, placing a native AWT Component within a Swing container hierarchy with customizations may cause unwanted side-effects and can therefor be disabled.

As of NetBeans 7.3, an additional option has been added to 
etc/netbeans.conf to disable mixing by default:

[source,java]
----

-J-Dsun.awt.disableMixing=true
----

In some cases, such as displaying OpenGL content via JOGL, it may be necessary to add a native component to a NetBeans TopComponent. In that case, the default setting breaks usability of the platform application by incorrectly drawing menus and other lightweight components behind the native component. To re-enable the mixing, the above option needs to be set to false:

[source,java]
----

-J-Dsun.awt.disableMixing=false
----

For reference, see link:http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/webnotes/tsg/TSG-Desktop/html/awt.html[Oracle Notes on AWT]


Applies to: NetBeans 7.3 and above
