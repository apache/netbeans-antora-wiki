== Testing Things That Use FileObject/DataObject/DataFolder

If your unit tests use `FileObject` (including `DataObject` or `DataFolder`), then you may be suprised that `FileUtil.toFileObject(java.util.File)` returns `null`. This is because the MasterFS filesystem implementation is what maps `FileObject`s to your local disk and it needs to be on the classpath when tests are run.

See xref:UsingFileSystemsMasterfs.adoc[UsingFileSystemsMasterfs] for more info on how to fix this.

If for some reason you prefer not to use MasterFS, you can create a new `LocalFileSystem`, create some files and use that instead of `FileUtil.toFileObject` in your test.  For example, in a `NbTestCase` subclass:

[source,java]
----

FileObject dir;
public @Override void setUp() throws Exception {
  super.setUp();
  clearWorkDir();
  LocalFileSystem fs = new LocalFileSystem();
  fs.setRootDirectory(getWorkDir());
  dir = fs.getRoot();
}
----

If your test just needs some simple data in a FileObject or two, you can avoid writing to disk at all as follows:

[source,java]
----

FileObject dir;
public @Override void setUp() throws Exception {
  super.setUp();
  dir = FileUtil.createMemoryFileSystem().getRoot();
  //write out data your tests will use to files under dir/ here
}
----

If you want to write tests for a `DataObject` or `DataLoader`, you may also want to set the mime type correctly: xref:DevFaqTestDataObject.adoc[DevFaqTestDataObject]
