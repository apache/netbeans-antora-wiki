== How do I get at the file that a particular node represents?

In general, it shall be enough to request a xref:FileObject.adoc[FileObject] via xref:Lookup.adoc[Lookup]:

[source,java]
----

Node n = ...;
FileObject fo = n.getLookup().lookup(FileObject.class);
if (fo != null) {
    File f = FileUtil.toFile (fo);
    if (f != null) { //if it is null, it is a virtual file -
                     //its filesystem does not represent disk-based storage
       //do something
    }
}

----

If this does not work for some (strange) reason. You may fallback to old good way and get the `DataObject` the node represents, and drill down to a file from there

[source,java]
----

Node n = ...;
DataObject dob = n.getLookup().lookup(DataObject.class);
if (dob == null) {
    // definitely not a file node
} else {
    // could also get all files in the data object, if desired:
    FileObject fo = dob.getPrimaryFile();
    // and if you really need java.io.File
    File f = FileUtil.toFile (fo);
    if (f != null) { //if it is null, it is a virtual file -
                     //its filesystem does not represent disk-based storage
       //do something
    }
}

----

In the other direction you can use `DataObject.find` and then `DataObject.getNodeDelegate`
to get a node representing a file object.

Also see xref:DevFaqFileVsFileObject.adoc[DevFaqFileVsFileObject] if you need `java.io.File` for some reason.
