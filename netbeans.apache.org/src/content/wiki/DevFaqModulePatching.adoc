== How do I create a patch for a preexisting NetBeans module?

If you need to patch an existing module, you can place a JAR file relative to the original.
For example, to patch `ide/modules/org-openide-example.jar`
you make a JAR like `ide/modules/patches/org-openide-example/mypatch.jar`.
The `mypatch` part of your JAR file patch can be named anything you like.
The JAR file should only contain those classes you want to patch.
It does not need a manifest, though an empty manifest is harmless.

The patch must be in the same cluster as the original. ()
If you want to create an NBM containing a patch,
you must ensure it will be installed in the same cluster
(use the `nbm.target.cluster` property),
but note that you cannot test such a dummy module as part of a module suite
(since this property is interpreted only by Plugin Manager).
If you are distributing a complete application including a patch to the NB Platform,
you will need to either manually preinstall the patch JAR in your copy of the Platform;
or override your `build-zip` target to include the JAR in the final ZIP
(in which case testing using *Run Project* will not have the patch active).


Applies to: NetBeans 6.x
