== Why doesn't my JavaHelp content show up?

The first thing to check is that your JavaHelp configuration files are correct. Since these files contain IDs and file paths, it is easy to make a mistake. Unfortunately, the JavaHelp system does not provide you with much warning when such an error occurs.

It is also worth noting that the JavaHelp implementation in NetBeans IDE 6.5.x and earlier link:https://bz.apache.org/netbeans/show_bug.cgi?id=160276[seems to require the .html file extension].
