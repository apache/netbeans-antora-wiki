== How can I operation occasionally on a background thread, but reschedule it if something happens to delay it?

There are a lot of reasons you might want to reschedule a background operation.  For example, you want to re-parse a file 3 seconds after the user stops typing, so you can show errors.  But at 2 seconds she starts typing again.  You don't want that task to run a second from now anymore.  You can either cancel the task, or even simpler, call `task.schedule(3000)` every time a key is pressed.  If it was already scheduled, it will be rescheduled for 3 seconds from now again.

Or imagine you have the situation described in xref:DevFaqRequestProcessor.adoc[the FAQ about RequestProcessor.getDefault()] - a node for a file needs to read the file after it is created to mark itself if the file has errors.  `RequestProcessor.Task` makes this sort of thing easy.

public class FooDataNode extends DataNode implements PropertyChangeListener, Runnable {
  private boolean error;
  private static final RequestProcessor THREAD_POOL = new RequestProcessor("FooDataNode processor", 1);
  private final RequestProcessor.Task task = THREAD_POOL.create(this);

  FooDataNode(FooDataObject obj) {
    super(obj, Children.LEAF);
    obj.addPropertyChangeListener(WeakListeners.propertyChange(this, obj));
    task.schedule(100);
  }

  public void propertyChange(PropertyChangeEvent evt) {
    DataObject obj = (DataObject) evt.getSource();
    if (DataObject.PROP_MODIFIED.equals(evt.getPropertyName()) &amp;&amp; !obj.isModified()) { //file was saved
      task.schedule(100);
    }
  }

  @Override
  public String getHtmlDisplayName() {
    return error ? "<font color=\"!nb.errorForeground\">" + getDisplayName() : null;
  }

  public void run() {
    boolean old = error;
    error = doesTheFileHaveErrors();
    if (old != error) {
      fireDisplayNameChange(null, null);
    }
  }

  private boolean doesTheFileHaveErrors() {
    assert !EventQueue.isDispatchThread();
    //parse the file here
    return true; //whatever the value should be
  }
}
