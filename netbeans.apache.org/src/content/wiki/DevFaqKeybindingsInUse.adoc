== How do I find out which keybindings are already in use?

For an existing release you can look at e.g. xref:KeymapProfileFor60.adoc[KeymapProfileFor60] to see the specification.

If you are developing a module for NetBeans development builds,
you can just look at
link:http://deadlock.netbeans.org/hudson/job/nbms-and-javadoc/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/nbbuild/build/generated/layers.txt[this file]
in the section `Shortcuts/`.
This will show all global keybindings being used by modules in the standard IDE
as well as experimental update center
in `link:http://hg.netbeans.org/main/[http://hg.netbeans.org/main/]` and `link:http://hg.netbeans.org/main/contrib/[http://hg.netbeans.org/main/contrib/]`
as of a few hours ago.

Editor-specific keybindings are listed in `Editors/*/*/Keybindings/` folders,
which is unfortunately harder to browse through.

Be conservative about adding new keybindings;
they are a precious resource.
Be careful with bindings using `Alt`, as these often clash with mnemonics,
Linux window manager shortcuts, etc.
If at all possible, use a multistroke binding:
for example, `Shortcuts/D-J R C.shadow` binds the 3-stroke sequence `Ctrl-J R C`.
