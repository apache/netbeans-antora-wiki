=== I've already signed a JCA; do I still have to sign the CA?

If you've already signed a JCA for a contribution to netbeans.org, then you do not have to sign a CA for additional contributions. However, if you intend to contribute to other Oracle open source projects (such as GlassFish, MySQL or OpenJDK) in addition to netbeans.org, then you may wish to sign a new CA, which will cover all such projects.
