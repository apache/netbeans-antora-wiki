The *autoload* in the xref:../index.adoc[NetBeans] module system world means that certain module is turned on when _needed_. In contrast to regular modules which require some manual action (user locating a module and activating it) to turn them on, the *autoload* modules are opaque for users and managed solely by the infrastructure. As soon as there is some module needing (by dependency or require/needs token) an *autoload* module, the infrastructure enables it.

In the link:http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/OSGi[OSGi] mode, the meaning of *autoload* remains as close as the original meaning. The bundle JAR is registered to the underlaying link:http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/OSGi[OSGi] framework, but it is not _started_ until there is some NetBeans module which would depend on the bundle. If there is no such xref:../index.adoc[NetBeans] module, the link:http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/OSGi[OSGi] bundle remains in _installed_ state (or _resolved_?).

The *autoload* mode is most suitable for link:http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/OSGi[OSGi] bundles which shall be left in the full control of the link:http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/OSGi[OSGi] container. For example there can be other link:http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/OSGi[OSGi] bundles which may later _start_ such bundles. Such enablement is outside of control of the xref:../index.adoc[NetBeans] module system and is temporary (on subsequent launch of the system the module remains *autoload.adoc*).
