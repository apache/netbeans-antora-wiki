== How do you change the configuration of other modules?

Without adding a dependency to the other module?

Once you found out the property file (from the userdir), where the setting is located, you can set the configuration via code:

For example your setting in located in
`config/Preferences/org/netbeans/modules/subversion.properties`

a) So you can set it via the NbPreferences-API
`
NbPreferences.root().node("org/netbeans/modules/subversion")....
`

b) Or use the branding approach from link:http://wiki.netbeans.org/DevFaqPropertySheetHideDescription[http://wiki.netbeans.org/DevFaqPropertySheetHideDescription]
