== What is an ExplorerManager?

You do not directly set the Node that is displayed by an xref:DevFaqExplorerViews.adoc[Explorer view ] component (Swing components that display xref:DevFaqWhatIsANode.adoc[Nodes ]) by calling a method on that component.  Rather, you set that kind of information by finding the _manager_ for that component - it's what is in charge of what node is displayed, selected, etc.

The manager may be explicitly set on an Explorer view, but usually this is not necessary.  When you add a view component (such as a link:https://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/orgOpenideOxplorer/org/openide/explorer/view/BeanTreeView.html[BeanTreeView ]) to a Swing container, it will search backward through its parent, it's parent's parent, and so forth, looking for a component that implements link:https://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/orgOpenideOxplorer/org/openide/explorer/ExplorerManager.Provider.html[ExplorerManager.Provider ] (an interface with one method - `getExplorerManager()`).  That ExplorerManager is what will determine what is displayed.

While this may seem like an unnecessary layer of indirection, it is actually quite powerful:  It makes it possible to very simply create master-detail views ala Windows Explorer:  Just add two views to a JPanel subclass that implements link:https://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/orgOpenideOxplorer/org/openide/explorer/ExplorerManager.Provider.html[ExplorerManager.Provider ].  It is very easy to set it up so changing the selection in one causes the other one to show the children of the selected object - just the way selecting a folder in Windows Explorer does.

See also the link:https://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/orgOpenideOxplorer/org/openide/explorer/ExplorerManager.html[ExplorerManager javadoc ].  The xref:DevFaqCreateExplorerPanel.adoc[FAQ about showing explorer views in the main window ] includes sample usage of ExplorerManager.
