== What is the Contributor Agreement ("CA")?

The CA is an innovative vehicle used by Oracle for copyright assignment on contributions to its open source projects. The Oracle Contributor Agreement (OCA) applies to contributions to any product or project owned or managed by Oracle, including projects on link:http://netbeans.org/projects[netbeans.org].

The OCA defines various types of contribution, covers its copyrights, patents and enumerates acceptable licenses. Specifically, with the OCA, if the contribution embodies a patent which the Contributor owns, then by signing the OCA the Contributor gives Oracle and all other recipients a license to use that patent.
