== Writing Tests For DataObjects and DataLoaders

Quite easy. At least in NetBeans 6.5 and newer. Everything shall work as 
declarative MIME resolvers are loaded automatically from unit tests and 
loaders are available from unit tests automatically.

Example code is below:

[source,java]
----

    private static final String BAD_MANIFEST_CONTENT =
            "Manifest-Version: 1.0\n" +
            "junk junk junk\n" +
            "some more junk\n";
    private static final String GOOD_MANIFEST_CONTENT =
            "Manifest-Version: 1.0\n" +
            "Java-Bean: true\n" +
            "OpenIDE-Module-Name: com.foo.bar\n\n";

    @Test public void checkContent() throws Exception {
        FileSystem fs = FileUtil.createMemoryFileSystem();
        FileObject good = fs.getRoot().createData("good.mf");
        writeFile(GOOD_MANIFEST_CONTENT, good);
        DataObject goodDob = DataObject.find(good);

        FileObject bad = fs.getRoot().createData("bad.mf");
        writeFile(BAD_MANIFEST_CONTENT, bad);
        DataObject badDob = DataObject.find(bad);

        YourInterface y = goodDob.getLookup().lookup(YourInterface.class);
        y.doYourTest();
    }

    private void writeFile(String content, FileObject file) throws Exception {
        OutputStream os = file.getOutputStream();
        os.write(content.getBytes("UTF-8"));
        os.close();
    }
----

In the somewhat unusual case in which your unit test resides in a different module from that which contains your file support code (DataLoader, DataObject, etc.), you will need to add a `<test />` dependency on the module which contains the file support code.  Currently this can only be done by editing the `project.xml` file for the module containing your unit tests.  See the build harness' README for more information; you can find the relevant section by searching for `test-dependencies` in that file.

=== Older versions than 6.5

If you are writing a test for a `DataObject`,
you need to set up enough of the `DataLoader` infrastructure
that `DataObject.find()` will locate your `DataLoader`
and call it to create your `DataObject` subtype.

First, use the setup code described in
xref:TestingThingsThatUseFileObjectDataObjectDataFolder.adoc[Testing Things That Use File Objects].
Add to the test's `setUp()` method a call to `FileUtil.setMIMEType()`
to manually assign the file extension to the MIME type of your `DataLoader`.

[source,java]
----

FileUtil.setMIMEType("mf", "text/x-manifest");
----

(`setMIMEType()` is deprecated with respect to usage from inside a module,
but it is fine to use it in a unit test).

(For XML file subtypes, `FileUtil.setMIMEType()` on `*.xml` is not likely to work.
You can instead register a `MIMEResolver` in default lookup which does whatever you need.)

Second, you need to make sure your `DataLoader` is registered in the
xref:DevFaqLookupDefault.adoc[default Lookup]
so that `DataObject.find()` will find it.
In 6.0, the *New File Type* template will set this up automatically
by creating the correct file in `test/unit/META-INF/services`.
(Or you can get better control by using `org.openide.util.test.MockLookup`.)
