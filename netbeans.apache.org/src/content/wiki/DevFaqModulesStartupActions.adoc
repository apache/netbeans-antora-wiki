== How do I run some code when my module starts/loads/unloads?

To run some code when your module is loaded, and basically every time the IDE starts and your module is enabled, simply create a subclass of `org.openide.modules.ModuleInstall` and override the `restored()` method. Bear in mind that this is being executing during the time the IDE/platform is starting up. You should limit the work you do here to that which is absolutely necessary.

Once the class is created, you must declare it in your module's `manifest.mf` file, like so:

[source,java]
----

OpenIDE-Module-Install: org/netbeans/modules/editor/EditorModule.class
----

Likewise, to execute code when the IDE is shutting down, you can override the `close()` method. This method of `ModuleInstall` is called when the IDE is shutting down, contrary to the `closing()` method, which is called to alert the module that the IDE is about to shut down. However, another module may veto the shutdown by returning `false` from the `closing()` method, so the `close()` method is best for performing any cleanup work for your module.

You can simply use *File > New File > Module Development | Module Installer* to create the `ModuleInstall` class and its registration in the manifest.


Applies to: NetBeans 6.5 and later
