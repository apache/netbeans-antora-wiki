== I've already signed a CA for another Oracle project, do I need to sign another one for NetBeans?

No. Once you execute an OCA, it is valid for all Oracle-sponsored projects. One OCA covers all of your contributions to all of these projects. However, before you
contribute to any Oracle-sponsored project you should contact the Oracle lead for that project. And remember, not all contributions will be used or incorporated into the code for the project.
