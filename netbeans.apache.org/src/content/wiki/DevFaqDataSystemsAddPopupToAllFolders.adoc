== How do I add an item to for every folder in the system?

There is a folder in the xref:DevFaqSystemFilesystem.adoc[System Filesystem ] called Loaders.  It is where various things are registered that apply to specific xref:DevFaqDataObject.adoc[DataObject ] types.  For example, there is a folder `Loaders/text/x-java` that contains things that pertain to Java files (notice that the path is a MIME type).  It has an `Actions` subfolder where you can add actions to the popup menu for Java files.

You may not think of a folder as being a file type, but to NetBeans it is.  There is a subfolder `Loaders/folder/any/Actions` which contains actions that should appear in the popup menu for folders.  Just add your action in your xref:DevFaqModulesLayerFile.adoc[layer file ] to that folder, i.e.

[source,xml]
----

<filesystem>
  <folder name="Loaders">
      <folder name="folder">
          <folder name="any">
            <folder name="Actions">
               <file name="com-foo-module-MyAction.instance"/>
          </folder>
        </folder>
      </folder>
    </folder>
</filesystem>
