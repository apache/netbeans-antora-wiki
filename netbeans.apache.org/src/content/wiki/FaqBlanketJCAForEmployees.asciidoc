=== Can my company sign a blanket CA for all its employees?

Yes, a company can sign a blanket CA that will apply to all its employees. In that case, a person authorized to sign document on behalf of your company (usually a VP or higher) must sign the OCA, indicating his or her title. Please contact the Oracle project lead before submitting a company-wide OCA. Among other things, we want to understand who from your company will be authorized to make contributions.
