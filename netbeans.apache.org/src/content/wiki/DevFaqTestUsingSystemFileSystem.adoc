== How do I test something which uses the System Filesystem?

There is a fake System FileSystem provided by as soon as FileSystem xref:API_Design.adoc[API] is on classpath. It understands xref:../index.adoc[NetBeans] layer definitions and is generally suitable for running unit tests.

In case you see difference from expected behavior:

* Try to run tests in xref:DevFaqUsingSimpletests.adoc[real mode]
* Report xref:../index.adoc[NetBeans] a bug (product platform/filesystems) with a test case
