== How do I hide the description area in property window

By tweaking the preferences of the "showDescriptionArea". In any layer.xml file (for example the one of branding) add

[source,java]
----

    &amp;lt;folder name="Preferences"&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;folder name="org"&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;folder name="openide"&amp;gt;
                &amp;lt;file name="explorer.properties" url="explorer.properties"/&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;/folder&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/folder&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/folder&amp;gt;
----

and then next to your layer.xml file create the explorer.properties that contains:

[source,java]
----

showDescriptionArea=false
sortOrder=0
----

I found this by looking at the PropUtils class in the NBP sources.
