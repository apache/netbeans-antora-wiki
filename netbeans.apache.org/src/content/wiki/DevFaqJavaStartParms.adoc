This is simple to do but hard to figure out.

. Define the run.args.extra property in the suite's platform.properties file. (i.e. run.args.extra=-J-Xms48m -J-Xmx512m)
. Add/edit this target to your suite's build.xml file:

[source,xml]
----

<target name="build-launchers" depends="suite.build-launchers">
        <replace file="build/launcher/etc/${app.name}.conf">
            <replacefilter token="/dev" value="/${app.version}" />
            <replacefilter token="-J-Xms24m -J-Xmx64m" value="${run.args.extra}" />
        </replace>
    </target>
----

. Build your application.

NOTE: The above will work with any distribution method (i.e. zip, installer, etc...)
