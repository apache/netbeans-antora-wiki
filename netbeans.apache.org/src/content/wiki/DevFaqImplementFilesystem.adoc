== I'm having trouble implementing this filesystem....

Be sure that what you really want to be doing is implement link:https://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-filesystems/org/openide/filesystems/FileSystem.html[FileSystem].  Unless you really need to access objects in a database, remote server, or some other such storage as if they were files, you are probably heading in the wrong direction.

If you do need to implement a FileSystem, you should probably start with link:https://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-filesystems/org/openide/filesystems/AbstractFileSystem.html[AbstractFileSystem] - it handles a lot of knotty locking semantics correctly and will save you a lot of time, effort and bugs.
