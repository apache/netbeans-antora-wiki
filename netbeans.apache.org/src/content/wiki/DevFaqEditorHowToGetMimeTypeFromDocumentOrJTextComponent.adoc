== How to get mime type from `Document` or `JTextComponent`?

WARNING: The API described here is not official! Check the javadoc for its
stability level.

[source,java]
----

    // Suppose you have javax.swing.text.Document
    String mimeType = NbEditorUtilities.getMimeType(document);

    // Suppose you have javax.swing.text.JTextComponent
    String mimeType = NbEditorUtilities.getMimeType(component);
----

The method accepting `JTextComponent` is generally more practical, because
`JTextComponent` or its subclasses is what you usually have to start with.
Internally the method calls the `Document` version of itself on the document
loaded in the component and returns its mime type (if it has any assigned). If
the document does not have mime type information attached (and non-Netbeans documents
generally don't) the method will use the component's `EditorKit` to get it.

---

Applies to: NetBeans 6.x, the algorithm in `NbEditorUtilities.getMimeType(JTextComponent)`
works fine in 5.0 and 5.5, but the method is not public.
