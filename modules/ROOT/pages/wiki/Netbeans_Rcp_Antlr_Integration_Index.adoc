== How can I add support for a new language via ANTLR?

This will serve as the index page that links to everything we know about how to integrate ANTLR into a NetBeans Platform application (go xref:./How_to_create_support_for_a_new_language.adoc[here] for javaCC).

* How to xref:./New_Language_Support_Tutorial_Antlr.adoc[highlight syntax and check errors] using ANTLR with the new NetBeans Parsing and Lexing API's.
* How to xref:./Netbeans_Rcp_Antlr_Format_And_Indent.adoc[format and indent] using ANTLR with the NetBeans APIs.
* How to xref:./Netbeans_Antlr_BracesMatching.adoc[match braces (and parentheses, brackets...)] using ANTLR. 

xref:./Antlr_Notes.adoc[Notes on the above].

Other useful links:

* xref:./AntlrInNetBeansJavaApplication.adoc[Integrating antlr grammar into the project] - this is written for NB 6.5 but has been tested in 6.7 and 6.8m1 (it's also a Kenai project)
