= I have a folder full of .instance files. How do I get any/all of the object instances?

Often registries of objects are created by placing files with the extension `.instance` into some folder in the xref:./DevFaqSystemFilesystem.adoc[system filesystem].  The task, then, is to turn a folder full of files into a collection of objects, and make sure we only get objects of the type we are interested in.  In NetBeans 6 it is very simple to do that:

[source,java]
----

Lookup myObjects = Lookups.forPath ("path/to/folder/in/sysfs");
Collection <? extends MyType> c = myObjects.lookupAll(MyType.class);

----

(note the separator is always / with NetBeans filesystems).

If you have a single `.instance` file and need to get an object for that, xref:./DevFaqFindInstance.adoc[see this FAQ entry].
