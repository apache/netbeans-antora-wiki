If you want to display it as a Node you can use:

[source,java]
----
org.netbeans.spi.java.project.support.ui.PackageView.createPackageView().
----

If you need just a list of packages it can be obtained by

[source,java]
----
ClassIndex.getPackageNames()
----

for jars which were scanned by indexing.
