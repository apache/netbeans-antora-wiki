When you click the close button in the top right corner the application closes. If you want to do something before the application closes (e.g. show a dialog with OK and Cancel options) or prevent it from closing, this is possible.

Make a class in your module that extends `org.openide.modules.ModuleInstall`. There is a *Module Installer* template that will create this class for you.

Override the `closing` method and insert your special logic.
If you return `false` the application will not exit.
