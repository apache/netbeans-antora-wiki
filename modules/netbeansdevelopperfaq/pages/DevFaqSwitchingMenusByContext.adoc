* Create your action and let it implement link:{apidoclink}org-openide-util/org/openide/util/actions/Presenter.Menu.html[Presenter.Menu]
* Return a special `JMenuItem` subclass that implements link:{apidoclink}org-openide-awt/org/openide/awt/DynamicMenuContent.html[DynamicMenuContent] from `getMenuPresenter()`
* Implement link:{apidoclink}org-openide-awt/org/openide/awt/DynamicMenuContent.html[DynamicMenuContent] methods to return the desired menu content, using link:{apidoclink}org-openide-windows/org/openide/windows/TopComponent.Registry.html[TopComponent.Registry] for finding the selected file in the editor.

link:https://bitbucket.org/jglick/dynamicmenudemo/[https://bitbucket.org/jglick/dynamicmenudemo/] also does something similar.

== Can I hide or show a whole menu or toolbar?

To hide a menu or toolbar you have to edit your `layer.xml` and append `_hidden` to the name of the desired menu or toolbar. You may also hide `*.instance` files.

<syntaxhighlight lang="xml" enclose="div" highlight="6">
<folder name="Menu">

[source,xml]
----

   <!-- Hide View menu -->
   <folder name="View_hidden"/>
   <folder name="SomeMenu">
       <!-- Hide a single menu item -->
       <file name="SomeAction.instance_hidden"/>
   </folder>
----

</folder>
<folder name="Toolbars">

[source,xml]
----

   <!-- Hide Edit toolbar -->
   <folder name="Edit_hidden"/>
----

</folder>
</syntaxhighlight >

It's generally much easier to do this from the NetBeans IDE, link:http://forums.netbeans.org/post-77476.html[as described here].

Note that to hide the Navigate menu one has to declare GoTo_hidden instead of Navigate_hidden (the menu was originally named GoTo, but was later renamed to Navigate by the means of Bundle.properties).
