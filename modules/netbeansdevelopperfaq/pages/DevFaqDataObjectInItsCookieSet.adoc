Most likely your `DataObject` does not put itself into its own `CookieSet`/`Lookup`.  If you call `setCookieSet()`, or override `getLookup()` or `getCookie()`, this can happen.  There are a few parts of NetBeans which will expect `Node`s to be present in their own `Lookup`s and `DataObject`s to be present in theirs.  It is always best to make sure they are there.  For a `DataObject`, the code for this is usually as simple as:

[source,java]
----

getCookieSet().add(this);
----
