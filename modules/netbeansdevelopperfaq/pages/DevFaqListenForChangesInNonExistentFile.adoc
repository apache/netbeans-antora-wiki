There are some cases where you want to listen for changes in a file or folder that does not exist, or may be created and deleted on the fly.

As of NetBeans 6.7, you can use link:{apidoclink}org-openide-filesystems/org/openide/filesystems/FileUtil.html#addFileChangeListener(org.openide.filesystems.FileChangeListener,%20java.io.File)[FileUtil.addFileChangeListener(FileChangeListener, File)] to listen for such changes. There is also FileUtil.addRecursiveListener
