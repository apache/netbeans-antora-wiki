== EditorRegistry

The editor keeps a registry of open editors;  you can track the active editor using the following code:

[source,java]
----

import org.netbeans.api.editor.EditorRegistry;

PropertyChangeListener l = new PropertyChangeListener() {
  public void propertyChange(PropertyChangeEvent evt) {
    JTextComponent jtc = EditorRegistry.lastFocusedComponent();
    if (jtc != null) {
      Document d = jtc.getDocument();
      // use the document
    }
  }
};

EditorRegistry.addPropertyChangeListener(l);
----

*IMPORTANT*: If you attach any listener to the `Document` or anything else in the active editor text component, remember to remove them when the active editor changes.

Please read javadoc on `EditorRegistry` to see details about the properties delivered through the listener used in the above code. There are many property changes fired and if an event comes it does *not* necessarily mean that the active editor has changed.

== NbDocument.findRecentEditorPane

If you have a `EditorCookie` you can use `NbDocument.findRecentEditorPane`
