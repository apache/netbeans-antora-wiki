Yes. See the link:{apidoclink}org-netbeans-modules-javahelp/overview-summary.html[JavaHelp Integration API]
which describes how to include JavaHelp documentation in a module under *Help > Contents*;
and you can provide rich context help
rather easily, linking into the same documentation.

There is an IDE wizard for creating a help set for your module.

Applies to: NetBeans 5.x, 6.x
Platforms: all
