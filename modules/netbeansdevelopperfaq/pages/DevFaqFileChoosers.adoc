As of NetBeans 6.7, `link:{apidoclink}org-openide-filesystems/org/openide/filesystems/FileChooserBuilder.html[org.openide.filesystems.FileChooserBuilder]` makes this easy.
Pass a `Class` or unique `String` key to the constructor of a `FileChooserBuilder`.
The next time the same key is passed, the new file chooser will automatically be rooted on the directory selected the last time.
