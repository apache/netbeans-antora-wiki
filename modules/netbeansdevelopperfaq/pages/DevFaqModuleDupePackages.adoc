Yes, NetBeans does permit multiple modules to load from a single package.
However, this should be considered poor style and avoided whenever possible.
In particular, the Java runtime forbids package-private accesses
between classes defined by different class loaders
(e.g. classes contained in different modules).

Applies to: NetBeans 6.1 and later
